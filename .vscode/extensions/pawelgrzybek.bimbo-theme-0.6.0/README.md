# Bimbo Theme (discontinued - replaced by Gatito Theme)

**Sorry for a stupid name — I didn't expect this theme to gain this popularity. Development of this theme has been discontinued. There is a new theme that is under active development, looks the same and very soon will get extra light version — [Gatito Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pawelgrzybek.gatito-theme). Uninstall this one now and go and grab a fresh stuff!**

All credit goes to the author of my favourite [Oceanic Next Color Scheme](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme) for developing this theme for Sublime Text. This is just a modification that is utilizing Visual Studio Code theming features.
